## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper reviews the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and the ways in which it interacts with the human immune system.
We explore the genomic content of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, and how it can be used to predict virus pathogenesis, transmission, symptomatology, and individual susceptibility.
We also investigate the regulatory and proteomic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immune response.
The results of this research will provide insights into the structure and behavior of the virus, which can be used to inform strategies to control the virus and treat the disease.
